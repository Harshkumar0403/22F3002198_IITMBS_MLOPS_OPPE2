Explainability Analysis: False Negatives (Heart Disease Not Predicted)

Definition:
False negatives are patients who actually have heart disease (target = 1)
but were predicted by the model as not having heart disease (prediction = 0).

Key Findings:
The SHAP analysis shows that the model’s incorrect decisions for these patients
are most strongly influenced by the following factors:

1. thalach
2. sno
3. trestbps
4. age
5. chol

Interpretation:
For false negative patients, these features tend to have values that make
the model interpret them as low-risk, even though they truly have heart disease.
In particular, lower ST depression, fewer major vessels, favorable chest pain
types, or higher exercise tolerance can mask the underlying disease.

Clinical Implication:
These results suggest that patients with mild or atypical symptoms may be
systematically under-predicted by the model, indicating a need for threshold
adjustment or cost-sensitive training to reduce false negatives.
